Governance is one of the major adoption challenges when it comes to cloud computing. Organizations find themselves "not ready" to consume cloud services whether that perception is more a gut feeling or comes from experience.

Microsoft works hard to built a rich toolset to cover many aspects of governance such as Azure Policy, Azure Blueprints, Azure Cost Management and many more. But tooling is only half the equation.

Tooling needs to be framed with people and processes to effectively govern the adoption of cloud services. Just this week Microsoft has released the next version of the **Microsoft Cloud Operating Model** which is coined **Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework**.

[Head out to the documentation](http://aka.ms/CAF) to start using the Cloud Adoption Framework today.
