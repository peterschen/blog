A request that I get many times is to provide guidance and best-practices on how to implement monitoring and operations management with and/or for Azure. Most organizations have subtle differences which makes it hard to put out a generic concept of how to enable this. There are high-level ideas but in my discussions with customers and partners I'm hearing that this is not detailed enough.

There are a good resources though if you want to get started. Microsoft CSA [Robert Kuehfus](https://github.com/rkuehfus) has created an [excellent multi-day hackathon](https://github.com/rkuehfus/AzureMonitoringHackathon) which covers many aspects of the process. Then there are the [Microsoft Cloud Workshops](https://github.com/Microsoft/MCW) of which one covers [Azure Security & Management](https://github.com/Microsoft/MCW-Azure-Security-and-Management).

Due to popular demand I have decided to create a hackathon on my own putting emphasis on data sources and how to connect them to a coherent picture. Feel free to use the resources for your own deliveries. If you find something to improve, put in a pull request and I'd be happy to incorporate it.

[I've published this on my GitHub](https://github.com/peterschen/blog/tree/master/azure/samples/monitoring-hackathon).
