Google just released beta support for Cloud Spanner dialect for Hibernate ORM. This enables Java (and other JVM based languages) developers integrating their applications directly with Cloud Spanner and helps them to increase productivity. Support for Hibernate ORM is built on top of the [open source Cloud Spanner JDBC driver](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/use-oss-jdbc).

More information can be found in the [Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/use-hibernate) and code/integration [samples can be found on GitHub](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-spanner-hibernate).
