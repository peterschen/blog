It just has become easier to manage Azure Security Center at scale. While not all aspects of Azure Security Center can be automated yet Microsoft just released updated Swagger definitions for working with Azure Security Center. [ This includes an updated documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/securitycenter/) where you can directly try requests to the API against your tenants you have access to.

It goes on. Bindings, clients or SDKs for [Go](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/services/preview/security/mgmt/2017-08-01-preview/security), [Ruby ](https://rubygems.org/gems/azure_mgmt_security)and [. NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Management.SecurityCenter/0.9.0-preview) as well as a [PowerShell module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/AzureRM.Security/0.1.0-preview) were released as well.
