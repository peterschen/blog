After spending close to eight years in different roles at Microsoft, my time with Microsoft has come to an end. I accepted a new role, starting on May 1st, as Chief Technology Officer with [HorseAnalytics](https://www.horseanalytics.com) an animal tech startup focused on providing a telemetry data platform for horses.

I will continue to work on Azure related topics in my new capacity although with a much broader focus than before including the Data + AI space with IoT and machine learning. It’ll be an interesting journey to grow into the new role and to switch sides from technical sales to technical executive, implementing the best practices I’ve been preaching for the last several years.

I’ll continue to work my blog, while the focus might change away from solely operations & management to a broader set of capabilities on Azure.
